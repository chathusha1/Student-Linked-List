# Student-Linked-List
This Java project implements a singly linked list data structure to manage student records containing student IDs and marks. The implementation includes all the basic linked list operations as specified in the exercise requirements.
Features

Link Class: Represents each node in the linked list with:
  Student ID and marks storage
  Reference to the next node
  Display functionality for the node's data
  
LinkedList Class: Manages the collection of nodes with operations:
  Insertion at beginning (insertFirst)
  Insertion after a specific node (insertAfter)
  Node search by student ID (find)
  Deletion operations (deleteFirst, delete)
  List display functionality
  Empty list check
  Comprehensive Testing: The LinkedListDemo class demonstrates all operations with sample data matching the exercise requirements.
  
How It Works
    Creates a linked list of student records
    Performs insertions at the beginning and after specific nodes
    Demonstrates search functionality
    Shows deletion operations (first node and specific nodes)
    Displays the list state after each operation

Sample Output
The program produces output matching the exercise requirements, showing the list state after each operation.
Usage

This implementation serves as:
    A learning resource for linked list data structures
    A reference for basic linked list operations in Java
    A foundation for more complex student record management systems

Requirements
    Java JDK 8 or later

Ideal For
    Computer science students learning data structures
    Developers needing a reference implementation of linked lists
    Educational purposes in algorithms and data structures courses
